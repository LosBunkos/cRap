          <h3>About c-Rap</h3>
            c-Rap, or as we call it - Contextual Rap was written as a final project for a 3-month Coding Bootcamp course at Elevation Academy.<br>
            The point of this little app was to practice our JavaScript, NodeJS and Textual Analysis skills to produce something fun. <br>
            We have written a JS engine that gets an input text from the user, analyzes it to remove stop words and categorizes the parts of speech (verbs, nouns and adjectives). Afterwards, it makes a call to the Datamuse API for rhymes and similar words (in case the input is too short). After collecting all the information, it throws everything into hard-coded sentence boilerplates and using Angular 1.x renders them on the page.
